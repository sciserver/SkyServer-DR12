<p><font color=white>The field with the most objects is field 756-3-756, which 
contains 3,628 objects. The cluster of stars in the middle of the field, between 
the two large, bright stars, is a globular cluster (Palomar 5). Globular clusters 
have many, many stars in a small area, so the SDSS software found many, 
many stars within this field.</font></p>
